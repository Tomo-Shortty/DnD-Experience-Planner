# DnD-Experience-Planner
Desktop application that helps DMs plan experience gains and encounters in their D&amp;D 5e campaigns (WIP)

This is a personal project that has been undertaken to provide Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Masters a tool they can use to easily plan encounters for their campaigns. They can also plan how much experience to give to their players over the course of a campaign.

I have also used this as an opportunity to practice C#.
